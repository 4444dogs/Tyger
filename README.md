# About
 Tyger is a general-purpose Revolt bot aiming to have features that are similar to the Discrod bot, Dyno.

 WARNING: This bot is still in pre-alpha so it is not recomended that you use as your primary moderation bot.

# How to get pre-alpha access
While you can self-host Tyger even while it's in pre-alpha, it is easier juist to add the primary instance. This is how you can get access to it.

1. Join the [Tyger Testing server](https://nightly.revolt.chat/invite/hg2HCTaW).
2. Go into the `Apply for PAA` channel.
3. Apply using the following format:
```
Why do you want Tyger? [ANSWER HERE]
Server Invite: [ANSWER HERE]
```
4. Wait for your response from one of the devs.
5. If they tell you that your request was excepted, they should send you a bot invite link. (Note that it will only work in the server that you attached when you applied.)
